Delta Hopper Vessel Stability 

## Description
Software for an automated container planning and placement application designed for the Delta Hopper container vessel.
## Visuals

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
- Clone project to target machine
- Run setup.py 
- Run binaries

## Usage
Execute .bat script to invoke the application. Ensure that manifests are located in the ./manifests folder and load plans are located in the ./load-plans directory
